Package ml provides some implementations of usefull machine learning algorithms for data mining and data analysis.

The implemented algorithms are:

	- Linear Regression
	- Logistic Regression
	- Neural Networks
	- Collaborative Filtering
	- Gaussian Multivariate Distribution for anomaly detection systems

Is implemented too the fmincg function in order to calculate the optimal theta configuration to reduce the cost value for all the implemented solutions.
